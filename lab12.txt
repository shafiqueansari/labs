1. WAP to create a tuple and append another tuple to it

   get the count of total members & repeated members

   similarly print length of this new tuple


tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
tuple2 = (6, 7, 8, 1, 2)  # This tuple contains some repeated elements like 1 and 2
new_tuple = tuple1 + tuple2

total_members = len(new_tuple)
print("Total members in the new tuple:", total_members)

repeated_members = {}
for item in new_tuple:
    repeated_members[item] = new_tuple.count(item)

print("Count of repeated members:")
for item, count in repeated_members.items():
    if count > 1:
        print(f"Element {item} is repeated {count} times.")

print("Length of the new tuple:", len(new_tuple))

output=

Total members in the new tuple: 10
Count of repeated members:
Element 1 is repeated 2 times.
Element 2 is repeated 2 times.
Length of the new tuple: 10

2:WAP to to deduce use of sorting in tuples.

tuple1 = (4, 1, 8, 3, 7, 2, 5)

sorted_tuple = tuple(sorted(tuple1))
print("Tuple sorted in  order:", sorted_tuple)

sorted_tuple_decreasing = tuple(sorted(tuple1, reverse=True))
print("Tuple sorted in decreasing order:", sorted_tuple_decreasing)


output=Tuple sorted in ascending order: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8)
Tuple sorted in descending order: (8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
