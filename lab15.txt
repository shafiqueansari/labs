

1. Write a function in Python to count and display the total number of words in a text file “ABC.txt” 

also count uppercase / lowercase character in same  text file

def count_words_and_characters(filedemo):
    word_count = 0
    uppercase_count = 0
    lowercase_count = 0

    file= open("C:\studentdemo.txt, 'r') 
        for line in file:
            words = line.split()
            word_count += len(words)

            for char in line:
                if char.isupper():
                    uppercase_count += 1
                elif char.islower():
                    lowercase_count += 1

    print(f"Total number of words: {word_count}")
    print(f"Total number of uppercase characters: {uppercase_count}")
    print(f"Total number of lowercase characters: {lowercase_count}")

count_words_and_characters("filedemo")



output=total number of words=98
total number of uppercase letter=9
total number of lowercase letter=72

2. Write a function display_words() in python to read lines from a text file "story.txt", and display those words, which are less than 4 characters.

def display_words(story.txt):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
        
            words = line.split()

          
            for word in words:
                if len(word) < 4:
                    print(word)

display_words("story.txt")
